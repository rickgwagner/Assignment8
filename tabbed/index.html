<h2>The Hitchhiker's Guide</h2>
<p>In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects.</p>

<p>First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words Don't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.</p>

<h2>Scheduled Demolition</h2>
<p>"People of Earth, your attention please," a voice said, and it was wonderful. Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep.</p>

<p>"This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning  Council," the voice continued. "As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system, and regrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less that two of your Earth minutes. Thank you."</p>

<h2>Marvin the Robot</h2>
<p>In the corner, the  robot's  head  swung  up  sharply,  but  then wobbled  about imperceptibly. It pulled itself up to its feet as if it was about five pounds heavier that it actually was, and made what an outside observer would have thought was a heroic effort to cross the room. It stopped in front of  Trillian and seemed to stare through her left shoulder.</p>

<p>"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said. Its voice was low and hopeless.</p>
